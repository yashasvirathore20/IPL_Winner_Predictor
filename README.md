# IPL_Winner_Predictor

Overview:

This project is a machine learning–based web application designed to predict IPL match outcomes and simulate complete tournament standings using historical data. It demonstrates an end-to-end data science and web development workflow, starting from raw CSV datasets to a deployed, interactive web interface.

The application uses Python for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. A Logistic Regression model is trained on cleaned IPL match data to predict the probable winner of a match based on relevant inputs. The trained model is then integrated into a Flask backend, which serves predictions through a simple and responsive frontend built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.

Users can predict the result of a single IPL match by providing match-related details or run a full tournament simulation where match results are generated iteratively and compiled into final standings. This makes the project useful for understanding sports analytics, machine learning deployment, and backend–frontend integration.

Overall, the project focuses on clarity, simplicity, and practical implementation, making it suitable as an academic project, portfolio showcase, or learning reference for machine learning and web application development.
